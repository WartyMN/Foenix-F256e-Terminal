# f/term F256e

## Overview

f/term is a terminal emulator for the [Foenix F256jr and F256K retro computers](http://wiki.f256foenix.com/index.php?title=Main_Page). This version is for the "expanded memory" version of the F256, and is not compatible with the classic MMU-based configuration and the Microkernel. If you do not own a Foenix computer, or if you don't know what one is, this software should have limited interest for you. Go back now before you are sucked into the world of programming and using 8-bit and 16-bit computers as if it was the 1980s. You have been warned. 

If you are a brand new F256 owner, congratulations! It's a great piece of hardware, and ton of fun to program. If you haven't already, jump on the Discord and share what you are working on.

### Features

- text-only terminal communications via serial port and WIFI 232. 
- support for much of the ANSI protocol. No support for blinking, 8-bit color, or other features not compatible with the Foenix hardware. 

### Coming Soon
- YMODEM download capability
